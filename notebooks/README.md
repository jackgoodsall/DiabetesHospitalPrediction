## Data visulisation

Data visulisation is done using AutoVIZ for faster and most efficient EDA and insights.

The main insights to get are that their are quite a few low information variables, mainly 'max_glu_serum', 'acetohexamide', 'tolbutamide', 'examide', 'citoglipton', 'glimepiride-pioglitazone', 'metformin-rosiglitazone', 'metformin-pioglitazone', and although these might have some small useful signal, for the purpose of this project will be excluded in order to speed up training and model deployment time.
